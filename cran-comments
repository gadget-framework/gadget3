The "donttest" CRAN test failure was caused by an example triggering a bug in TMB.
This is now fixed in TMB 1.9.13, and gadget3 tests are already passing.

Bugfix release to fix pretest NOTE:

> Found the following (possibly) invalid file URI:

/reference/index.html is the pkgdown reference index, which obviously does not
exist on CRAN. This has been fixed with the following commit:

==== 0.10-1

New release to fix CRAN-pretest problems.

Examples no not finish under Windows with --run-donttest, this appears to be a
bug in TMB:

  https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp/issues/385

The relevant example has been disabled under Windows as a workaround:

Test failure: donttest:
> Running examples in ‘gadget3-Ex.R’ failed
> > writeLines(TMB::gdbsource(g3_tmb_adfun(cpp, compile_flags = "-g", output_script = TRUE)))
> Error in system(cmd, intern = TRUE, ignore.stdout = FALSE, ignore.stderr = TRUE) : 
>   error in running command
> Calls: writeLines -> <Anonymous> -> system
> Execution halted

TMB::gdbsource() expects both `R` and `gdb` to be available on the path, the
example is now wrapped with a test to make sure this is the case before running:

==== 0.8-4

Resubmission of new package after comments from CRAN team:

> Missing Rd-tags:
>      step.Rd: \value

Section added.

> Missing Rd-tags:
>     aab_env.Rd:  \value

aab_env documents an environment, not a function. \usage removed instead of adding \value.

> Examples for unexported function
> lgamma_vec() in:
>     action_grow.Rd
>     action_migrate.Rd
>     action_naturalmortality.Rd
>        . . .

lgamma_vec() does not appear in any of the listed examples. However, based on the listed examples the test is objecting to occurences of '~g3_param(...)'.
These examples have been reworked to remove this.

==== 0.8-3

Resubmission of new package after comments from CRAN team:

> Please always write package names, software names and API (application programming interface) names in single quotes in title and description. e.g: --> 'R','C++'

Done.

> Please add the references to your description (i.e. in DESCRIPTION) text

Added references to the 'Description' field

> You have examples for unexported functions.

* Removed gadget3:::step_find_desc() from vignettes
* gadget3:::stock_instance Now public, as g3_stock_instance
* gadget3:::g3_native now public
* gadget3:::g3_global_formula now public
* gadget3:::g3_step now public

> Please ensure that your functions do not write by default or in your examples/vignettes/tests in the user's home filespace (including the package directory and getwd())

g3_tmb_adfun() defaults to 'work_dir = tempdir()', so agreed that explicit 'work_dir = tempdir()' in examples shouldn't be necessary.
