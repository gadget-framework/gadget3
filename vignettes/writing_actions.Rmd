## G3 Functions

There are also special g3 functions that can be used in formula that affect the
resulting code, rather than just being called when run.

See ``?g3_param`` for more information.

## G3 global environment

All G3 models have the G3 global environment included, which contains the
definition of generally useful functions. For example ``avoid_zero()``, used to
avoid div/0 conditions by adding a small amount of error close to zero.

See ``R/aaa_global.R`` for more information, and other existing helpers.

## Global & native functions

Some things aren't easy to do with code translation. ``g3_native`` allows you to
define a function with separate R and C++ definitions, for example ``logspace_add_vec``,
used in many actions to avoid div/0, has the following definition:

```
# vector<Type> form of logspace_add
g3_global_env$logspace_add_vec <- g3_native(r = function(a,b) {
    # https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp/issues/7#issuecomment-642559660
    pmax(a, b) + log1p(exp(pmin(a,b) - pmax(a, b)))
}, cpp = '[](vector<Type> a, Type b) -> vector<Type> {
    vector<Type> res(a.size());
    for(int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {
        res[i] = logspace_add(a[i], b);
    }
    return res;
}')
```

## Stock steps

Most actions interact with stocks, and fill out abstract formulae with the
stocks provided to the function. To do this you need to do a series of
substitutions, which are handled by ``g3_step()``. This takes a formula,
looks for ``stock_*`` named functions and mangles the formula as appropriate.
For example, a snippet from ``action_mature.R``.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
    out <- new.env(parent = emptyenv())
    out[[step_id(run_at, 1, stock)]] <- g3_step(f_substitute(~{
        stock_comment("g3a_mature for ", stock)
        # Matured stock will weigh the same
        stock_with(stock, stock_with(matured, matured__wgt <- stock__wgt))

        stock_iterate(stock, stock_intersect(matured, if (run_f) {
            stock_comment("Move matured ", stock, " into temporary storage")
            stock_ss(matured__num) <- stock_ss(stock__num) * maturity_f
            stock_ss(stock__num) <- stock_ss(stock__num) - stock_ss(matured__num)
        }))
    }, list(run_f = run_f, maturity_f = maturity_f)))
```

Assume that ``stock`` has name "ling_imm" and ``matured`` has name "ling_imm_maturing".

The first line uses ``stock_comment()`` to produce a ``comment()`` function
call, ``comment("g3a_mature for ling_imm")``.

Next ``stock_with()`` is used to to transform ``matured__wgt <- stock__wgt``
to use the proper stock names. We don't care about dimensions since we're
copying over all the data.

Finally, we use a combination of ``stock_iterate()`` and ``stock_intersect()``.
``stock_iterate()`` will create a loop that loops over all of the stock's
dimensions, and ``stock_ss()`` will subset ``stock__num``, prividing
1-dimension lengthgroup vector.  ``stock_intersect()``.

These iterators will then be available to the ``maturity_f`` that the users
provide, as demonstrated in the [Stocks] section.

## Writing R code destined for C++

Obviously R and C++'s type systems are quite different, and gadget3 attempts to
bridge the gap.

In R, there is no difference between a scalar and a 1-element vector. If you
expect to treat the variable as a vector or array, then state this explicitly
with ``array``, even if the result may be a 1-element vector. This means that
methods that work on TMB array or vector classes will be available.

One needs to be more careful with the type of constants in C++ than R. In
particular, ``x / 2`` means integer division. As a result, G3 will cast any
numeric constant as a double outside of certain situations, e.g. array indices,
which will be integer values. However, if you do want an integer it's best to
express this explictly, i.e. ``3L``. Note that there is no difference in R code
between ``3`` and ``3.0``.

## Sub-formulas and g3_global_formula

R forumlas all you to include extra definitions when defining a formula. This
allows you to break up a definition into more readable chunks. For example:

```
ling_imm <- g3_stock('ling_imm', seq(0, 50, 10)) %>%
    g3s_age(3, 10)
nmort <- function() {
    E <- ~stock__minlen * age
    F <- ~stock__minage  # TODO: Does this work now?
    ~E * F * 4
}
g3_to_r(list(g3a_naturalmortality(ling_imm, nmort())))
```

Note that:

* Because the definition of ``E`` refers to ``age``, gadget3 has automatically inserted it into the loop.
* ``F`` however can be defined outside the loop, so is.
* They are all defined in the step, not necessarily for the whole model function. In TMB this is enforced with scoping.

If you need to have something available to ther steps, it can be defined using
``g3_global_formula`` and providing an ``init_val``:

```
ling_imm <- g3_stock('ling_imm', seq(0, 50, 10)) %>%
    g3s_age(3, 10)
nmort <- function() {
    # Define a counter
    E <- gadget3:::g3_global_formula(
        ~E + 1, init_val = 0L)
    # We can just give init_val, to define something global to the model
    F <- gadget3:::g3_global_formula(
        init_val = 99L)
    ~E * F * 4
}
g3_to_r(list(g3a_naturalmortality(ling_imm, nmort())))
```

As well as making values available to other steps, ``g3_global_formula``()
can also be used to ensure that the value ends up in the model report, which will
happen automatically for any non-constant global in the model.

## g3_native

There are limits to what the Gadget3 transpilation can manage, particularly
once you need to operate on matrices. To get around this, you can define
functions using ``g3_native``, which annotates functions with a C++ definition.
For example, it is used to define ``logspace_add_vec``:

```
# vector<Type> form of logspace_add
g3_global_env$logspace_add_vec <- g3_native(r = function(a,b) {
    pmax(a, b) + log1p(exp(pmin(a,b) - pmax(a, b)))
}, cpp = '[](vector<Type> a, Type b) -> vector<Type> {
    vector<Type> res(a.size());

    for(int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {
        res[i] = logspace_add(a[i], b);
    }

    // NB: This is a string within R code, so we have to escape slashes.
    //     For example, "\\n"

    return res;
}')
```
