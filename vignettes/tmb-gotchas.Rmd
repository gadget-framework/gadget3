A grab-bag of things to be aware of when writing code that will get used in TMB.

## Links that are useful when getting to grips with TMB:

* http://kaskr.github.io/adcomp/matrix_arrays_8cpp-example.html
* https://kaskr.github.io/adcomp/structtmbutils_1_1array.html - TMB defines it's own array and vector classes. A vector isn't just a 1 dimensional array, it's got lots of extra methods.
* https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp/wiki/Code--snippets

## Arrays are one dimensional under the hood

A ``tmbutils::Array``, whilst based on an Eigen array, manages dimensions
itself. As a result if you call any inherited Eigen methods, dimensions can
disappear.

From https://kaskr.github.io/adcomp/structtmbutils_1_1array.html:

> Methods that are not documented here are inherited from the Eigen library and applied on the underlying n-by-1 array. In general this will yield surprising results for 2D specific array methods.

## Has to be some kind of return value

The return value in a g3 model, ``nll'', can't just be a hard coded value, has
to be e.g. a parameter There has to be at least 1 parameter, otherwise there
will be an Eigen error on return.

Obviously not a huge practical problem, but easily crops up in unit tests.

## Autofilling vectors

Can't do ``vector = single_value``, have to use ``vector.setConstant(single_value)``.

g3 will mostly handle this automatically, but seems like something that could
be fixed in TMB.

## VECTORIZE1_t macros

(documented in https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp/pull/329 )

The "R-like" functions TMB provides, such as ``lgamma()`` are defined using the
``VECTORIZE`` macros. These macros expect a single symbol, and will produce
mysterious errors if an expression is used.

Instead of ``lgamma(alpha + beta)``, do something like:

    lgamma_arg = alpha + beta; val_vec = val_vec + lgamma(lgamma_arg);

## No vector<int> to vector<Type> conversion

Can't do ``stock__num.col(...) = (integer vector)``, since this needs an
explicit cast. This is problematic for e.g:

    g3a_initialconditions(prey_a, ~10 * prey_a__minlen)

This case is a somewhat artifical construct, and not a problem for midlen
(which isn't integer), a more likely scenario.

No easy solutions, since gadget3 doesn't have enough type information and Eigen
needs explicit casts.

## TMB::gdbsource(interactive = TRUE) eats stderr

(documented in https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp/issues/341)

Any error messages in gdb are lost, which makes for a frustrating console
experience. Instead run the new R session yourself, with:

```
R -d gdb
(gdb) run --vanilla < /tmp/RtmpysTVvW/file3da4a6f13a80c.R
```

## Subsetting is by-reference

Subsetting will be by reference, unlike R. i.e the following will report 0:

```
DATA_ARRAY(x);
auto y = x.col(0);
x.col(0).setZero();
REPORT(y)
```

This is particuarly problematic with ``g3_with``, that currently uses ``auto``
to save deriving types properly.

A workaround is to force a copy to a vector, either by filling a
``vector<Type>`` variable or adding ``.vec()``. See stock__premigrate in
R/action_migrate.R.
