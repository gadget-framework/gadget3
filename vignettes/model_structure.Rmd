The following describes the structure of a gadget3 model, from the bottom up.

## R formula, or the tilde operator

Crucial to gadget3 is the [R formula](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/formula.html),
created using the tilde operator (``~``). These get used in several places in R for
various things, but at their core the tilde operator stores the R code on the
left and right hand sides, as well as the environment it was created in, which
amounts to all variables defined at the time.

For example, let's declare a function that produces a formula, and make some:

```{r}
get_formula <- function (size) {
    # NB: The reason we make a function here is so we have an isolated environment
    # to make examples cleaner.
    cows <- size * 2
    pigs <- size * 4
    return(~cows + pigs)
}
f <- get_formula(8)
g <- get_formula(5)
```

``str()`` shows ``f`` contains the formula's code (not the result of cows + pigs),
and has an environment attached:

```{r}
str(f)
```

We can look into this environment, and see the values that got set for cows & pigs:

```{r}
str(as.list(environment(f)))
```

We can do similarly for ``g``, and see the results are different:

```{r}
str(as.list(environment(g)))
```

Note that:

* R hasn't at any point worked out ``cows + pigs``, the code was stored for
  later use.
* The environment (i.e. all variables defined at that point) is "remembered"

A g3 model at it's core is a list of formula objects that make up the model.
We can even use Gadget3 to compile our simple example above into an R function:

```{r}
g3_to_r(list(f))
```

...or a TMB template:

```{r}
g3_to_tmb(list(f))
```

Obviously this in itself isn't a very useful function, but you can see that the
environment for the formula has provided the initial values for the variables,
and the code itself has been put into the main loop. 

Also note that, despite appearances, we're not generically converting R into
C++. There's a subset of R that gadget3 understands and knows how to convert.
Using R libraries isn't possible, for example. To simplify scoping rules, we
assume variables are either global, and should have different names, or are
iterators in loops, in which case they will be local to that loop.

## Actions

In reality you will never be providing formulae to insert into models directly,
you'd be using the g3 action functions to generate these for you. All action
functions, prefixed with ``g3a_``, produce a list of formula objects---an
action in gadget3 parlance. These are where the gadget functionality is
implemented.

One of the simplest is ``g3a_time``, which produces code that will count
years/steps, and stop when the end of the time period is reached. For example:

```{r}
g3a_time(1990, 1999)
```

Like in the example above, the definitions are part of the formula's
environment, and if we compile it we see our years ending up in the code.

```{r}
g3_to_r(g3a_time(1990, 1999))
```

In this case our years have been hard-coded, but their definitions could
themselves be formula and the end result will be added to the model. For
example:

```{r}
g3_to_r(g3a_time(1990, ~start_year + 4 ))
```

## Stocks

Beyond ``g3a_time()``, pretty much any action will be describing changes to a
stock, possibly via. interacting with another stock (or fleet). To keep track
of this state, we use *g3_stock* objects. These describe several things:

* The dimensions one would use if making an array to store data on that stock.
For example if we want an array for number of individuals, what lengthgroups do
we use? How many ages do we store? How many (and which) areas do we have?
* What code do we need to iterate over the stock? Say I want to add 1
individual to each lengthgroup, how do I loop over all the other dimensions?
* If looping over one stock, how do I find corresponding entries in another
stock? For example, my fleet is only interested in prey that is in the same
area.

g3_stock objects can be created with either ``g3_stock()`` or ``g3_fleet()``,
the former will store lengthgroups, which fleets do not have.

Actions will store data about the stocks, for instance the current number of
individuals, in arrays called stock instances. We can see what sort of arrays a
stock will make by using ``gadget3:::stock_instance``:

```{r}
ling_imm <- g3_stock('ling_imm', seq(0, 50, 10))
gadget3:::stock_instance(ling_imm)
```

To add complexity to our model, we can use other ``g3s_`` functions, such as
``g3s_livesonareas()`` or ``g3s_age()``, which adds area or age dimensions to a
stock:

```{r}
ling_imm <- g3_stock('ling_imm', seq(0, 50, 10)) %>%
    g3s_age(3, 10)
gadget3:::stock_instance(ling_imm)
```

```{r}
ling_imm <- g3_stock('ling_imm', seq(0, 50, 10)) %>%
    g3s_livesonareas(c(1,2)) %>%
    g3s_age(3, 10)
gadget3:::stock_instance(ling_imm)[,,'age3']
```

When you use an action such as ``g3a_growmature()``, you provide g3_stock(s) to
act on, and formula objects to fill in gaps in the code. ``g3a_growmature()`` will
iterate over all areas/ages the stock has, and apply growth for each length
group it finds.

``g3a_growmature()`` itself doesn't care about areas or age, it
just does the same to each. However, the formula you supply can. ``age`` and
``area`` variables will be set with the current age/area, which you can use
when writing formula. For example:

```{r}
fn <- g3_to_r(g3a_growmature(
    ling_imm,
    impl_f = g3a_grow_impl_bbinom(
        delta_len_f = ~age * 10,
        delta_wgt_f = ~area * 20,
        beta_f = ~g3_param("ling.bbin"),
        maxlengthgroupgrowth = 4),
    transition_f = ~TRUE))
fn
```

...you can see our provided formula have been used to calculate
``ling_imm__growth_l`` and ``ling_imm__growth_w``, and ``age`` and ``area`` are
available to us thanks to the loops provided by the stock.

We can also define formulas and reference them. Gadget3 will add the
definitions into the code where appropriate. For example:

```{r}
custom_delta_l <- ~area * 99
custom_delta_w <- ~ling_imm__plusdl * 44
fn <- g3_to_r(g3a_growmature(
    ling_imm,
    impl_f = g3a_grow_impl_bbinom(
        delta_len_f = ~age * custom_delta_l * 10,
        delta_wgt_f = ~area * custom_delta_w * 20,
        beta_f = ~g3_param("ling.bbin"),
        maxlengthgroupgrowth = 4),
    transition_f = ~TRUE))
fn
```

Note that ``custom_delta_l`` is recalculated every loop, since it uses
``area``, whereas ``custom_delta_w`` is calculated once for the step.

## Model parameterization

In the ``g3a_growmature`` function above, we see a reference to
``g3_param("ling.bbin")``. The ``g3_param()`` function is pseudo-code that
specifies the model should accept a parameter at this point. In the R code,
this has been converted to ``param[["ling.bbin"]]``, so when we call our R
function, we can provide a value, e.g. ``fn(list(ling.bbin = 6))``. We can also
use ``g3_param_vector()`` to provide a model with a vector of values.
See `?g3_param` for more information on this and other functions available to you.

When converting to TMB, there are a lot more options for using the optimisation
features it offers.

## Combining actions

Any useful model will have multiple actions, so the outputs from the ``g3a_``
functions need to be combined. To do this, you can pass a list of actions to
any of the ``g3_to_*`` functions, for example:

```{r}
ling_model <- g3_to_r(list(
    g3a_age(ling_imm),
    g3a_growmature(
        ling_imm,
        impl_f = g3a_grow_impl_bbinom(
            delta_len_f = ~age * 10,
            delta_wgt_f = ~area * 20,
            beta_f = ~g3_param("ling.bbin"),
            maxlengthgroupgrowth = 4)),
    g3a_time(1990, 1999)))
```

A useful technique is to break down the actions into separate lists, e.g.

```{r}
ling_imm_actions <- list(
    g3a_age(ling_imm),
    g3a_growmature(
        ling_imm,
        impl_f = g3a_grow_impl_bbinom(
            delta_len_f = ~age * 10,
            delta_wgt_f = ~area * 20,
            beta_f = ~g3_param("ling.bbin"),
            maxlengthgroupgrowth = 4)))
time_actions <- list(
    g3a_time(1990, 1999))

ling_model <- g3_to_r(c(ling_imm_actions, time_actions))
```

Your actions can be combined in any order, the reasons for why are in the next
section.

## Ordering of actions

Gadget2 has a strict [Order of Calculations](https://gadget-framework.github.io/gadget2/userguide/chap-order.html),
and re-ordering calculations may well have averse effects. Actions also have
common steps to perform, for example overstocking for a prey has to be
calculated, and calculated once, after each fleet has finished harvesting.

To manage this, formulas within an action are labelled with a string, for
example:

```{r}
lln <- g3_fleet('lln') %>% g3s_livesonareas(1)
lapply(
    g3a_predate_fleet(
        lln,
        list(ling_imm),
        suitabilities = list(
            ling_imm = g3_suitability_exponentiall50(
                ~g3_param('ling.lln.alpha'),
                ~g3_param('ling.lln.l50')),
            ling_mat = g3_suitability_exponentiall50(
                ~g3_param('ling.lln.alpha'),
                ~g3_param('ling.lln.l50'))),
        catchability_f = g3a_predate_catchability_totalfleet(1)),
    # NB: step_find_desc finds a label within the formula
    function (s) gadget3:::step_find_desc(s, minor_steps = TRUE))
```

We see each step has a colon-separated name, including the following parts:

* A number corresponding to the order of calculations. If you look at the
gadget2 user-guide, consumption is step 3. This can be controlled using the
``run_at`` parameter of ``g3a_predate_fleet()``, or any other action.
* Another number specifying the order within an action this step should be
performed.
* The prey and where relevant the fleet name
* A hash, that corresponds to the parameters of the
``g3a_predate_fleet()`` call.

When a G3 model is made, it will sort the combined list of steps by name, and
remove duplicates by name. This means that:

* Predation will happen at the correct part of the model cycle.
* Predation steps themselves will be ordered. So all defined predation steps
will collect their catch (``003:001``) before overconsumption is calculated
(``003:004``). There's no explict process needed to interleave multiple predation
actions.
* The overconsumption co-efficient for ling_imm will only be calculated once,
regardless of the number of predation actions, since we will remove the
duplicate versions of this step.
* Conversely the hash ensures that there are never duplicate versions of the
main predation step, so could be repated. This is more relevant for renewal,
where there can be multiple renewal actions working on the same stock.
